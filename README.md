# UNI-CySec1-Python-Challenges  

This repository contains all solutions to facultative Python challenges from the course **"Cybersecurity 1"** hosted at Saarland Univeristy.  
These challenges were very demanding, making them open to volunteers - those who wanted to learn more than other students. Naturally I did them all :smiley:  

Solutions are crafted in clear and concise manner, and they contain a lot of comments. They may be of great help to those who are also passionate about cybersecurity:
